#summary Missing features that would be nice to have
= Introduction =

We are currently swamped with work on the main Timepedia website, so there were many features we had to scale back or remove for this release, the following is a list of major features we envision for future versions of Chronoscope


= Alternate Rendering Platforms =

  * Flash canvas implementation
  * Applet/Consumer JRE
  * J2ME

= New Dataset Types =

  * TupleDataset: values are (X,Y,Z,W,...), e.g. (X, Open, High, Low, Last)
  * Dataset2D: indices are 2D, values can be scalar or tuple, e.g. d2d.getValue(i,j)
    * LatLongDataset2D: lookup values by latitude/longitude, e.g. ll2d.getValue(lat, long)
  * Category Dataset: XYDataset with X values as Strings
  
= New Plot Types =
  * CategoryPlot
  * TuplePlot
  * Plot2D: plot Dataset2D
  * TimelinePlot: 3 dimensional plot with third axis being a time slider

= New Renderer Types =
  * CategoryRenderer
  * CandleStickRenderer (TuplePlot)
  * PieRenderer
  * HeatMapRenderer: used by Plot2D
  * CountourRenderer: used by Plot2D
  * TimelineRenderer


= New Axis Types =
  * LogAxis
  * CategoryAxis
  * TimelineAxis

= New Marker/Overlay Types =
  * Axis Marker (like Google Finance 'split' symbols)
  * Annotation (text like callout on a curve)
  * MarkerGroup: multiresolution representation of markers, cut down on clutter when zoomed out, click to expand

= Retained Mode Vector Graphics API =
  * Create and position shapes on the canvas
  * Bind shape properties to chart state
  * Efficient hit detection and rendering via spatial partitioning
  * Want to permit 'gapminder' style charts

= Sparklines ==
  * In legend
  * anywhere in page as a link to a particular chart section
  * minimize Chronoscope ChartPanel into a sparkline representation

== SharedDomain and SharedRange Plots ==
  * Combine any two plots into a SharedDomainXYPlot for example (like Google Finance)

I'm sure there's alot more that *you* can think of, so free feel to suggest features, and don't shy away from contributing implementations!
