#summary Missing features that would be nice to have
= Introduction =

We are currently swamped with work on the main Timepedia website, so there were many features we had to scale back or remove for this release, the following is a list of major features we envision for future versions of Chronoscope


= Alternate Rendering Platforms =

  * Flash canvas implementation
  * Applet/Consumer JRE
  * J2ME

= New Dataset Types =

  * TupleDataset: values are (X,Y,Z,W,...), e.g. (X, Open, High, Low, Last)
  * Dataset2D: indices are 2D, values can be scalar or tuple, e.g. d2d.getValue(i,j)
    * LatLongDataset2D: lookup values by latitude/longitude, e.g. ll2d.getValue(lat, long)
  * Category Dataset: XYDataset with X values as Strings
  
= New Plot Types =
  * CategoryPlot
  * Plot2D: plot Dataset2D
  * TimelinePlot: 3 dimensional plot with third axis being a time slider

= New Renderer Types =
  * CategoryRenderer
  * PieRenderer
  * HeatMapRenderer: used by Plot2D
  * CountourRenderer: used by Plot2D
  * TimelineRenderer


= New Axis Types =
  * LogAxis
  * CategoryAxis
  * TimelineAxis

= New Marker/Overlay Types =
  *
