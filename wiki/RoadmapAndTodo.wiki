= Milestones =

== .85 (ETA: late February 2008) ==
  * RangeMutableXYDataset - all features of Appendable datasets, plus supports modifying Y values of already added points issue 2
  * Auto-precision/scaling of Axis labels issue 3
  * upside-down marker bug issue 6

== .90 ==
  * Flash canvas (IE) GSS support issue 4
  * Shared domain charts (two plots sharing X axis, eg price/vol)  issue 10
  * bar chart fixes issue 5
  * generalized multi-resolution partitions algorithm  issue 8
  * interpolation options issue 1 

== .95 ==
  * upside-down marker rendering bug issue 6
  * sparklines issue 7
  * limit scope to available data (eg don't zoom before/after or finer resolution than dataset)  issue 11
  * support arbitrary x-axis plots (CategoryPlot) issue 12

= Roadmap =

== Alternate Rendering Platforms ==
  * Applet/Consumer JRE
  * J2ME
  * iPhone

== New Dataset Types ==
  * TupleDataset: values are (X,Y,Z,W,...), e.g. (X, Open, High, Low, Last)
  * Dataset2D: indices are 2D, values can be scalar or tuple, e.g. d2d.getValue(i,j)
    * LatLongDataset2D: lookup values by latitude/longitude, e.g. ll2d.getValue(lat, long)
  * Category Dataset: XYDataset with X values as Strings
  
== New Plot Types ==
  * CategoryPlot
  * TuplePlot
  * Plot2D: plot Dataset2D
  * TimelinePlot: 3 dimensional plot with third axis being a time slider

== New Renderer Types ==
  * CategoryRenderer
  * CandleStickRenderer (TuplePlot)
  * PieRenderer
  * HeatMapRenderer: used by Plot2D
  * CountourRenderer: used by Plot2D
  * TimelineRenderer

== New Axis Types ==
  * LogAxis
  * CategoryAxis
  * TimelineAxis

== New Marker/Overlay Types ==
  * Axis Marker (like Google Finance 'split' symbols)
  * Annotation (text like callout on a curve)
  * MarkerGroup: multiresolution representation of markers, cut down on clutter when zoomed out, click to expand

== Retained Mode Vector Graphics API ==
  * Create and position shapes on the canvas
  * Bind shape properties to chart state
  * Efficient hit detection and rendering via spatial partitioning
  * Want to permit 'gapminder' style charts

== Sparklines ==
  * In legend
  * anywhere in page as a link to a particular chart section
  * minimize Chronoscope ChartPanel into a sparkline representation

== Shared Domain and Shared Range Plots ==
  * Combine any two plots into a SharedDomainXYPlot for example (like Google Finance)
