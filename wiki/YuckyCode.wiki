#summary Chronoscope code base needs a janitor.

== Checkstyle ==

In trying to rush this release, we haven't had time to fix checkstyle bugs. We welcome the help in cleaning up the code.

== Missing Javadoc ==

Not every class/method is documented, and many are only tersely documented. If you see a Javadoc entry that could be written better, feel free to suggest replacement text.

== Abstraction issues ==

Currently, Chronoscope is hardwired to XYDatasets. It would be nice if code could be generalized further *without sacrificing performance*.
