<h2>Chronoscope Benchmark</h2>

<p>
  This benchmark runs 10 trials, each of which forces Chronoscope to do 100 full
  redraws, each drawing about 1,000 points. Each frame within a trial is
  slightly zoomed in order to cause different segments of the multiresolution
  data to be rendered. This benchmark doesn't work in Internet Explorer,
  for several reasons (IE version uses Flash, not Canvas. IE version is
  several times slower.).

<p>Click the Bench button to start, do not move the mouse over the chart while
  the benchmark is running, nor touch the keyboard.</p>

<em>Note: This benchmark "phones home" via an invisible GIF when done, to report the version number of the benchmark, the mean, and the standard deviation scores. We use this information to improve Chronoscope's performance.
