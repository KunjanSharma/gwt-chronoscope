This subdirectory contains a simple entry point that enables microformat processing, 
and calls onChronoscopeLoaded(), so that people can use chronoscope with the JS
API or Microformats without having to use the GWT API.

The widget can be deployed as a directory to an HTTP server accessible directory,
or it can be deployed as a WAR file (to enable the server-side FontBook service)
